\chapter[Practical Hybrid Quantum-Classical Computing]{Practical Hybrid Quantum-Classical\\Computing} \label{chap:practical-hybrid-quantum-classical-computing}
This chapter is focused on the practical execution of \glspl{hqca} using the Quantum Inspire quantum computing platform and SURF's \gls{hpc} center.
First, an overview of the classical and quantum infrastructure is given.
Then, \glspl{hqca} discussed in \Cref{chap:hybrid-quantum-classical-algorithms} are implemented and used for benchmarking and identifying the bottlenecks of the current infrastructure.
