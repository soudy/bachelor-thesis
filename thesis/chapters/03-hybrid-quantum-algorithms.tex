\chapter[Hybrid Quantum-Classical Algorithms]{Hybrid Quantum-Classical\\Algorithms} \label{chap:hybrid-quantum-classical-algorithms}
At the end of the previous chapter, two important quantum algorithms were reviewed: the \gls{qft} and Grover's algorithm.
These quantum algorithms and the family of algorithms built on them require large-scale quantum computers with low error rates and high coherence.
The \gls{nisq} devices that are being built now and in the near future will not be able to run these algorithms.
To this end, \acrfullpl{hqca} that utilize both classical and quantum resources are being researched and developed.
This chapter will first introduce the general concept of \glspl{hqca} followed by a review of well-known and promising \glspl{hqca}.

\Acrlongpl{hqca} account for the limited number of qubits, limited connectivity of qubits, and limited coherence times of \gls{nisq} devices.
