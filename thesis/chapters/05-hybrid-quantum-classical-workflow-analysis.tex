% A wait time of several days is not uncommon for cluster computers. As cluster computers aim to perform calculations that would take months or even years on a regular PC, a couple of days waiting is generally considered acceptable.
% Ultimately, one is interested in minimizing the amount of  time  it  takes  to  run  a  complete  experiment
% maximum running time of an experiment is defined as max_iter*T_{iter}
%   where T_{iter} = T_{latency} + T_{quantum} + T_{optimize}
